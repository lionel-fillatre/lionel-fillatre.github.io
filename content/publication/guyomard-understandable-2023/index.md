abstract: 'ReLU neural networks suffer from a problem of explainability because they
  partition the input space into a lot of polyhedrons. This paper proposes a constrained
  neural network model that replaces polyhedrons by orthotopes: each hidden neuron
  processes only a single component of the input signal. When the number of hidden
  neurons is large, we show that our neural network is equivalent to a logistic regression
  whose input is a non-linear transformation of the processed signal. Hence, the training
  of our neural network always converges to a unique solution. Numerical simulations
  show that the loss of performance with respect to state-of-the-art methods is negligible
  even though our neural network is strongly constrained on robustness and explainability.'

abstract: Vessel noise classification is generally considered as a challenging task
  due to its need for robustness and reliability. Thus, classification in this domain
  mainly relied on expert feature. Raw waveform architectures have been historically
  avoided, despite their performances in other domains. This paper proposes a Learning-based
  Scattering Transform (LST) that efficiently learns temporal dependencies within
  cyclostationary signals, such as vessel noises. The LST is implememented as a Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN) with short filters whose structure mimics a multiscale signal
  decomposition. By this way, the architecture of our neural network is intrinsically
  explainable. Numerical simulations compare our method to an other explainable model
  and classic convolutional neural networks.

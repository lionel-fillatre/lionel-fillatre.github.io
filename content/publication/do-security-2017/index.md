abstract: Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are highly distributed
  systems used to control and monitor geographically dispersed assets-often scattered
  over thousands of square kilometers-in which centralized data acquisition is critical
  to system operation [1]. These large-scale industrial control systems (ICSs) have
  been playing an extremely important role in most safety-critical infrastructures
  [2], such as electric power grids, transportation systems, communication networks,
  oil and gas pipelines, water distribution and irrigation networks, and multiple
  facilities including heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems for buildings,
  and traffic control systems for airports-the list is long. These safety-critical
  assets, however, are becoming increasingly susceptible to cyber-physical attacks1
  on both physical and cyber layers [3].

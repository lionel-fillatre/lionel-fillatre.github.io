abstract: The importance of features interactions for classification tasks between
  two classes is proven by the abundance of high-performance machine learning methods
  using them. In this paper, we take our inspiration from Bayesian Networks (BNs),
  a famous classification method whose main asset is the graphical representation
  of links between features. In the case of discrete feature, we assume that the features
  follow a tree-based distribution under each class. Then, we show that the optimal
  Bayes classifier coincides with a logistic regression whose features are one-hot
  encoded with a specific scheme. We show the advantages of such an approach both
  theoretically and numerically, especially showing that the learning step always
  converges toward a unique solution. Simulated experiments confirm the efficiency
  of the one-hot logistic regression with feature interaction encoding.

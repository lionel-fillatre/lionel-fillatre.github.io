This interdisciplinary project aims to develop new methods in mathematics and computer science to stratify patients into homogeneous groups based on biological variables, i.e., biomarkers. This approach would be particularly useful in the field of psychiatry, where it is now established that patients with the same symptoms, such as schizophrenia, actually suffer from different pathologies. The aim is to develop a multi-partitioning algorithm based on biological data to discover new clinical interpretations.

This project has been funded by the ANR (French National Research Agency).

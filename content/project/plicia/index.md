The Consortium, comprised from French Tech, includes QuantifiCare, i3S (CNRS), Hosteur and Inria. QuantifiCare is the project leader, with a total investment of 3 million euros. The main objective of this collaboration is to accelerate QuantifiCare’s technological trajectory and propel medical research by capitalizing on a large pre-existing database.

Launched by Bpifrance, this collaborative R&D project, called PLICIA (Plateforme Logicielle d’Imagerie Clinique intégrant de l’Intelligence Artificielle or Clinical Imaging Software Platform integrating Artificial Intelligence), has been accredited by the EUROBIOMED competitiveness cluster, in response to the “i-Demo” call for tenders, an action of the Future Investment Program. This project has been funded by the Region and the government as part of the France 2030 Plan.
